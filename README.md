This project demonstrates setup of Storybook controls with Webpack 5 and React along with different use cases. The application is heavily inspired by [todomvc](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/active).

It is a companion project for my [LogRocket article](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/sebastianweber/) about Storybook [controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls).
